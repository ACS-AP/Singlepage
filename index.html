              in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.

          <p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">
            Our Sun (a star) and all the planets around it are part of a galaxy known as
            the Milky Way Galaxy. A galaxy is a large group of stars, gas, and dust bound 
            together by gravity. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The Milky Way 
            is a large barred spiral galaxy. All the stars we see in the night sky are in 
            our own Milky Way Galaxy. Our galaxy is called the Milky Way because it appears 
            as a milky band of light in the sky when you see it in a really dark area.<br /><br />
            It is very difficult to count the number of stars in the Milky Way from our position 
            inside the galaxy. Our best estimates tell us that the Milky Way is made up of approximately 
            100 billion stars. These stars form a large disk whose diameter is about 100,000 light years.

          <p data-aos="flip-right" data-aos-duration="2000">
            Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – 
            the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets 
            such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.
            Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in the night sky. 
            So far, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the 
            Milky Way, with more planets being found.<br /><br />
            Most of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to have planets of 
            their own, and the Milky Way is but one of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.
            While our planet is in some ways a mere speck in the vast cosmos, we have a lot of company 
            out there. It seems that we live in a universe packed with planets – a web of countless stars 
            accompanied by families of objects, perhaps some with life of their own.

              An asteroid is a minor planet of the inner Solar System. 
              Historically, these terms have been applied to any astronomical
              object orbiting the Sun that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope.

            <p>
              A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the 
              Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process that is called outgassing.

              A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a comet, 
              asteroid, or meteoroid, that originates in outer space and survives its passage
              through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon.

                This is no ordinary space photo: It is 16 years’ worth of Hubble data—7,500 
                exposures in total, including more than 265,000 galaxies. But that’s not all. 
                Some of the galaxies in this image are so ancient, they date back to almost the 
                beginning of the universe. That means that most of the light you see here as tiny specs 
                of starlight, the light from galaxies full of planets and black holes and a myriad of mysteries, 
                has been traveling through the universe for the last 13.3 billion years. Hubble is not just a telescope, 
                t’s a time machine.

                The universe is Unfathomably large. Still, a picture from deep space can often reacquaint us with its 
                vastness and blow our minds yet again. The Hubble Space Telescope has spent years staring into what’s 
                out there, collecting the light from faraway objects. Many years ago, it completed a Wide Field Survey 
                and NASA released a photo that showed thousands of galaxies from just a tiny patch of sky. They appeared 
                in all colors and shapes; the entire image field was full of them.
